# Karhunen-Loève (KL) Expansion

## First Impression of KL Expansion

Remind that *Fourier Series* decomposes a real periodic function $f(t)$ into simple single-frequency orthogonal components. Note that this function is **deterministic**. In other words, we know $f(t)$ and use it to compute the Fourier coefficients in the analysis process.

The *Karhunen-Loève Expansion* can be regarded as an extension of Fourier Series from a deterministic function to a random function (generally called **stochastic process**), where a stochastic process can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal functions, analogous to Fourier Series.

Karhunen-Loève expansion is also closely related to the *Singular Value Decomposition* (SVD).
