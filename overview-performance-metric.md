# 1. Performance Metrics

## 1.1. Bit Rate

The number of bit states, or binary information entities, that a channel can transmit per unit time. For example, a peice of wire that can be set to high (bit 1)or low voltage (bit 0) can be configured to do the transitions 1000 times per second. The bit rate would be 1000 bits per second.

## 1.2. Symbol Rate

More bits can be transmitted at the same time if they are encoded in a predefined scheme, like QPSK, where 2 bits are encoded in a symbol. If 1000 symbols can be transmitted per second, the bit rate of the system is then 2000 bits per second.

Bit rate and symbol rate are design parameters.

## 1.4. Data Rate

Date rate is a general metric.

## 1.3. Throughput

Throughput is usually measured in bits per second, and sometimes in data packets per second or data packets per time slot.

## 1.5. Capacity

## 1.6. Bit Error Rate (BER)


## Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)

## Energy per Bit to Noise Power Density Ratio $E_b/N_0$

It is a normalized SNR measure, also known as the "SNr per bit". $E_b$ denotes the signal energy associated with each user data bit. It is equal to the signal signal power $P_s$ divided by the bit rate $R_b$ (not symbol rate $R_s$), i.e. $E_b=P_s/R_b$. The unit of $E_b$ is **joules** (watt-seconds, watt-per-hertz). $N_0$ is the noise spectral density, the noise power in a 1 Hz bandwidth, or the total noise power divided by the bandwidth, in unit joules.
